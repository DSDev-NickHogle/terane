for next release
----------------

 * delete segments as per index retention policy.
 * implement segment optimization using DB->optimize().  this will probably
   require a separate pthread.  need to investigate what happens if this 
   procedure is cancelled (does optimize use pthread_testcancel()?).
 * re-add query restrictions.
 * add new XMLRPC method ExplainQuery: show how query is parsed, an estimate
   of the number of results, what indices will be used, etc.
 * add new XMLRPC method ShowIndices: display statistics about each local
   index.
 * make TOC.count_segments() and TOC.count_fields() more accurate, by
   implementing internal counters.
 * build a configuration template system, so the most common input sources
   are simple to configure and standardized.
 * parse nagios events.
 * parse postfix events.
 * parse mysql server and slow query events.
